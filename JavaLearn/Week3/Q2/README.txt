Thue–Morse weave. 
Write a program ThueMorse.java that takes an integer command-line argument n and prints an n-by-n pattern like the ones below. Include two space characters between each + and - character.
The Thue–Morse sequence is an infinite sequence of 0s and 1s that is constructed by starting with 0 and successively appending the bitwise negation (interchange 0s and 1s) of the existing sequence
